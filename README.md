**INTENDED FOR DEDICATED SERVERS

If you intend to use these for commercial panel / virtual servers / personal use, go ahead. I just ask that you give me credit for it or leave a testimony of how it has benefited you here:  http://forums.keenswh.com/post?id=7099011

Thank you!

The author of this script is not responsible for any damage to the game save or the machine it is run on.

Player removal if no blocks owned.

This powershell script is used by changing the variables at the top of the 'ps1' file to match your server settings.

The default settings will delete players from the game if they do not own any blocks. If these actions also empty out a faction, the faction will also be deleted.

Be sure to shut your space engineers server down before running this script!!!

Use the windows shortcut provided to run. Be sure the shortcut and the script file are in the same folder.
